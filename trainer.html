    <h2><b><span>OVERVIEW </span></b></h2>
<div><span>This Train-the-Trainer Kit is primarily designed for the novice trainer but portions of it should be beneficial to experienced trainers. It provides content and materials necessary to facilitate three options for two (2) clock-hours of training based on the Global Anti-Corruption Education &amp; Training Initiative (ACET) materials. Each option of instruction is designed around the 42-minute ACET Movie, ETHICANA<b>&trade;</b>, which presents a fictional yet realistic case study about the disastrous effects of corruption in the engineering and construction industry. </span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span><o p=""></o></span></div>
<div><b><span>OPTION A:&nbsp;</span></b><b><span>ETHICANA&trade; viewed prior to session: </span></b><span>This option requires the trainee to watch ETHICANA&trade; prior to the training session, which counts as ~40 minutes of the training. Face-to-face training then consists of eighty (80) minutes of discussion on various elements of corruption portrayed in the movie, selected by the trainer or trainee. Approximately seven issues are to be discussed, averaging 10-minutes in duration, as follows: <o p=""></o></span><span>The trainer and/or the trainees are to select and discuss approximately 7 questions or issues provided in the Excel file: &ldquo;54 Issues for Discussion&rdquo; included on the DVD, also downloadable at </span><span><a href="index.html">www.ethicana.org</a></span><span>. </span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span><o p=""></o></span></div>
<div><b><span>OPTION B: </span></b><b><span>On-site viewing of ETHICANA&trade; based on &ldquo;54 Issues&hellip;&rdquo; </span></b><span>This option is identical to Option A except ETHICANA&trade; is viewed at the beginning of the session, followed by discussion of approximately 7 issues from &ldquo;54 Issues for Discussion.&rdquo; </span></div>
<div><span><o p=""></o></span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><b><span>OPTION C: </span></b><b><span>On-site viewing of ETHICANA&trade; - with discussion based on Training Guide on the DVD or downloadable at </span></b><span>www.ethicana.org</span><span>. This option consists of two one-hour parts associated with Part I and Part II of the movie. Each of the two 1-hour sessions consists of four segments: <o p=""></o></span><span><o p=""></o><br />

<h2>Train-The-Trainer Kit (Step-By-Step)</h2>
<p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS: </strong><strong>STEP 1. </strong>Preview Materials Familiarize yourself with the contents of this Kit. In particular, review the Sample Agendas, decide which option (A, B or C) is best for your circumstances, preview the 42-minute movie, and preview the PowerPoint slides used during the training session.</p>
<p><strong>STEP 2. </strong>Schedule the Training Schedule the date and time for the Training, identify the attendees who will be invited, and identify where the Training will be held. A sample notice (for posting or emailing to trainees) to advertise the Training is included on the DVD with updates downloadable from the Internet. It is recommended that the trainer send the &ldquo;Photos and Job Descriptions of the 12 Primary Characters in ETHICANA&trade;&rdquo; (downloadable from the DVD or website) in paper form or digital format prior to showing the movie, regardless of which option below you use. Option A, B, and C consist of two hours of training duration each. Option A requires the Trainees to view ETHICANA&trade; prior to the training session, whereas Options B and C show ETHICANA&trade; at the beginning of the training. For options B and C, the training can be successfully conducted starting with the lunch hour where, during the first part of the training (during which ETHICANA&trade; is introduced and viewed), trainees are eating lunch. Size of Group of Trainees and Facilities Suggested: Option A consists of one Training Session of ~80 minutes duration after trainees have viewed ETHICANA&trade; on the organization&rsquo;s intranet from their office, home, travel, etc. The size of the group is not critical when using this option, because no TV viewing is required. For Options B and C, the facilities vs. the size of the group are more important. As a general rule, for groups of 12 or fewer persons, the movie can be shown on a 27-inch TV. For groups of 20 or more persons, it is better to project a larger image using an LCD projector.</p>
<p><strong>STEP 3.</strong> Audio-Visual Equipment, Handouts &amp; Forms<br />
Audio-visual equipment checklists are included in this Kit. In its most simple form, this equipment will consist of a TV/DVD (or laptop), an LCD projector, and a flip chart. PowerPoint slides associated with this Kit are on the DVD.</p>
<p>
Global Anti-Corruption Education &amp; Training (ACET) Initiative Page 4 of 6<br />
The appropriate equipment should be obtained, staged in the room prior to the Training, and checked out to make sure everything works correctly. This Kit also contains a Handout entitled 54 Issues in Ethicana. This should be provided to the trainees in digital form well in advance of the training session if possible. If not possible, a suitable number of handouts should be printed prior to the event.</p>
<p>
Suggested agendas for each of the three options are available on the DVD and at <a href="index.html" title="www.ethicana.org">www.ethicana.org</a>. Once the Training Agenda is selected, the Agenda should be edited to reflect the specific details of the training event and should be printed and distributed to the trainees. An attendee roster is also included, which should be passed around for signatures at the beginning of the training session, and again at the end, if desired.</p>
<p><strong>STEP 4. </strong>Event-day Check On the date of the Training, sufficiently prior to the event, all audio-visual equipment and printed materials should be in place, in the training room. Audio-visual equipment should be checked out and confirmed ready for operation. The Instructor should be familiar with the AV equipment, all handouts, and should have all presentation slides conveniently available.</p>
<p><strong>STEP 5. </strong>Conduct the Training The Trainer selects the option (A, B, or C) that he/she wants to use during this training session. Note: subsequent training for the same trainees may benefit from switching the methods. The Trainer conducts the training session(s) in accordance with previous suggested guidelines in this Kit.</p>
<p><strong>STEP 6. </strong>Assessment/Evaluation of the Training. Assessment of this training is at the discretion of the Trainer. Two suggested assessment forms are included on the DVD and/or downloadable at <a href="index.html" title="www.ethicana.org">www.ethicana.org</a>. Standard assessment forms are usually available from Human Resources. Informal conversations with trainees following the event will usually provide useful information about the effectiveness of the training. The Trainer may choose to informally ask the group what they liked most and liked least about the training, or to send in any suggestions for improvement, if the trainees wish to do so.</p>
<p><strong>STEP 7.</strong> File Paperwork, Collect Materials Upon completion of the training, Trainers record the attendance, assessment notes, and any other notes for improvements for future training sessions.</p>
